# Seats Project

Please do not spend more than three to four hours on this project (it's ok if you don’t have time to finish).

**What we’re looking for (in order of importance):**

- Code quality/readability (including commit messages)
- Good component/directory structure
- Completeness + presentation

## Submission

Please fork this repo and push your code to that fork (it will be private to you). When you're done completing the project, please invite us to your fork so that we can review it (we can provide you with the github username to invite by email).

## Assignment details:

We’d like for you to build an interactive seat map in the Javascript framework of your choice (React, Angular, Vue, etc.). We do use React at Lola, but please use whatever framework you feel most comfortable with.

If you decide to use React, there is a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) template already supplied in this repo (you can look at the [docs here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)). Feel free to use it or replace it with the template/framework of your choice.

The seat map should be dynamically generated by the dummy data located here: https://github.com/lolatravel/seats-project/blob/master/src/data/seats.json

Here's a mock of what the final result should look like. If you prefer, you can also come up with your own design and not use this one, but you will be judged on the presentation of the project (but feel free to innovate and make this better!).

Seats have a cabin class (first, business, economy), a row (1, 2, etc.) and a letter assignment. They can be occupied, available or selected (only 1 should be selectable at a time - in the wireframe, that's the pink one).
The aisle in a cabin class is determined by a missing letter in the seats (i.e. a, b, d, e - ‘c’ is missing, so that’s where the aisle is).
Cabin classes should be programmatically generated to support any number of rows / columns.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions! We're excited to see what you're gonna come up with.
