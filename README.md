# Corey Angelus's Submission

Thank you for inviting me to participate in this challenge. Below are a few instructions and notes to get it working.

**Getting Started:**

- if you do not have Ruby on Rails, React or PostgreSQL installed, please do so
- run `$ bundle`
- run `$ bundle exec rake db:drop && bundle exec rake db:create && bundle exec rake db:migrate && bundle exec rake db:rollback && bundle exec rake db:migrate && bundle exec rake db:seed`
- run `$ yarn install`
- run `$ rails s`
- in another tab, run `$ yarn run start`
- navigate to `localhost:3000`
- run `$ rspec` to run test suites
